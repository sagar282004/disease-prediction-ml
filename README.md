# Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning algorithms to predict diseases based on user-provided symptoms. It demonstrates how clinical symptom data can be used to build predictive models that assist in early medical diagnostics.

 Features

- Binary symptom-based feature set
- Multiple machine learning classifiers (SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree)
- Cross-validation for robust evaluation
- Oversampling to handle class imbalance
- Accuracy metrics and confusion matrix visualizations

 Algorithms Used

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest Classifier
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree

 Dataset

The dataset includes various binary features representing symptoms (1 = present, 0 = absent), and the target column is the diagnosed disease.
